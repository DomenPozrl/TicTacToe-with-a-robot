# TicTacToe with a robot, bachelor thesis

Many people are worried about the intense presence of robots in our everyday lives. It turns out that the people, who are worried, are also the same people who never had much contact with robotics. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to develop a system that enables a robot manipulator to play a perfect game of TicTacToe. With the help of an algorithm for optimal decision making in the game of TicTacToe and using various methods of computer vision and robotics, we have developed a system, which introduces its users to robot-human interaction using a game they know since their childhood. 

This repository contains all of the code used for my bachelor thesis. All of the code is stored in a single file because of the robot interface restrictions. It makes it a bit harder to read but sections are still split using a block of comments. Otherwise the code is reasonably well commented and does not require any other thorough explenation.

This code is not meant to be run on a local machine but rather copied and pasted into the Manus (https://github.com/manus-project/manus) web interface. Once pasted, the code can run on a robot manipulator described in this article (http://prints.vicos.si/publications/344/open-source-robotic-manipulator-and-sensory-platform).
